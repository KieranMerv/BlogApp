      <p>This is a minimalist, simple blog application with basic CRUD operations and authentication powered by Microsoft Identity. It serves as part of the portfolio of Mervin Wee, an aspiring web developer in the midst of a mid-career switch.</p>
      <p>While care has been taken to make this application secure, it has not undergone industrial testing, so it is not recommended for any sensitive information to be input. Register with a fake email address, or an email address that is just for casual use.</p>
